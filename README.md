Guess My Number Game

Built Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The Guess My Number game is an interactive browser-based project where the user tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer.
The game provides real-time feedback such as “Too High”, “Too Low”, and “Correct!” based on the user’s input. It also includes score tracking, high score saving, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.

This project helped me understand several important frontend concepts including:

DOM Manipulation

Event Handling

Conditional Logic

Updating UI Dynamically

Handling User Input

Basic Game Algorithms

Clean & Structured JavaScript Coding
